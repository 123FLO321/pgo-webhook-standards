# PGo Community Webhook Standards
The goal of this project is to provide a standard webhook definition that can
 be collaboratively defined and implemented between different projects. This 
 standard will allow for consistent communication between different 
 applications, allowing users to combine applications where needed. 

## Current Collaborators
* [PokeAlarm Team](https://github.com/PokeAlarm)

## Who decides on the standards?  
Modifications will be presented as PRs, and current collaborators will be asked
 for feedback. In the event of a dispute, decisions will be made in support from 
 the majority of collaborators. 

## How can I become a collaborator? 
If you are a owner in a project that wishes to have a say in the community
 standards, please open a PR to add yourself (or your team) to the `CODEOWNERS` 
 file and list your project on the `README`. All teams engaged in active, 
 reasonably popular projects will be allowed to participate - provided their 
 projects continue to implement the standards and the teams remain cooperative 
 with the rest of the collaborators.
